## 🚀 How Students Will Use This

### Option 1: Complete Automation (Recommended!)

**Just 2 commands:**
```bash
cd ~/work/OR
source venv/bin/activate
python my-orlm/run_training_pipeline.py
```

That's it! Everything runs automatically:
1. ✅ Setup environment
2. ✅ Train with QLoRA
3. ✅ Merge model
4. ✅ Test inference
5. ✅ Convert to GGUF
6. ✅ Deploy to Ollama

**Estimated time**: 2-4 hours (depending on GPU)

### Option 2: Step-by-Step (If preferred)

```bash
# One-time setup
python my-orlm/setup_environment.py

# Training
python my-orlm/train_qlora.py

# Merging
python my-orlm/merge_model.py

# Testing
python my-orlm/test_inference.py

# GGUF conversion
python my-orlm/convert_to_gguf.py

# Ollama deployment
python my-orlm/deploy_ollama.py
```

    --skip-ollama
```

This will:
1. ✅ Check environment setup
2. ✅ Validate paths and files
3. ✅ Load and test the model
4. ⏭️ Skip the slow steps
